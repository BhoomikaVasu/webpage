    <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS, and enables developers to build responsive user interfaces, handle events, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). JavaScript can also be used for server-side development with environments like Node.js, making it a full-stack language.</p>
